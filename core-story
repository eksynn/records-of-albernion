PRELUDE
The region of Bernia was once ruled by a massive foreign empire. When that empire broke apart, the region fell into various warring states, rules by warlords and monarchs of little legitimacy. Eventually the Region was unified by Bernhardt "The Great", who founded the Kingdom of Bernia before passing shortly after.

When he passed, his new kingdom broke between his many sons. The recently pacified region was thrown back into another era of mass conflict. Eventually, The Great's son Berhardt II "The Wise" managed to reunite the kingdom from his brothers through a a combination of cunning, pragmatism and sheer might. With this reunification, the Kingdom once again entered a period of peace and widespread economic prosperity.

CORE STORY
Shortly after reuniting his father's kingdom, Bernie receives a horrifying notice from his spymaster. It turns out that a pretender to the throne remains! And with a strong claim no less. Worse, that pretender is known to be somewhere in Cross City, a city mostly beyond the reach of his power, a sovereign city-state sitting right atop a major trade artery between his kingdom and his main rival power, the state of El-Eshum.
